      <div class="inroduce-text">Hi I am Levi Lv Meiyi, an aspiring programmer stepping into the professional world. I
        love playing basketball
        and
        staying active, and I enjoy working in teams. I am familiar with Java, JavaScript, C, Python, as well as Linux
        and MySQL.
        I like exploring new technologies, sharing knowledge, and bringing energy and enthusiasm into everything I do.

        Beyond the Screen:

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="Acknowledgements">
      <div class="Acknowledgements-text">
        <ul>
          I didn't begin my journey as a programmer with a clear plan. At first, it was simply curiosity — a desire to
          understand
          what really happens behind the screen. Over time, that curiosity turned into practice, and practice slowly
          became a
          habit.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          I enjoy building things from scratch and embracing the challenges that come with debugging and failure. Along
          the way, I
          met Xiaoyun Li, Xinshuo Ji, Wei Li, Zichen Wang, Bo Qu, and Chang Wei. They are more than classmates or
          collaborators to
          me; they are friends, even family. Programming, for me, is not just about writing code. It's a way to train my
          thinking,
          solve problems, and learn patience.
        </ul>
        <ul></ul>
        <ul>
          This blog started with a simple idea — I wanted a place to document what I'm learning, how I think, and how I
          grow. It
          doesn't need to be perfect; it just needs to be honest and allow me to move forward, step by step. For a long
          time,
          though, I didn't have a clear direction. That changed during my internship at Boeing. There, I met Eric Zhang,
          who
          studied
          abroad and brought a completely different perspective. He inspired me deeply, helped me strengthen my
          weaknesses, shared
          experiences and ways of thinking that no textbook could teach, and showed me what real depth looks like.
          <ul></ul>
          Another person who had a profound impact on me at Boeing was my senior manager, Ben Dou. When I felt uncertain
          about my
          future career, he gave me guidance at a critical moment. Unlike teachers in school who often speak in abstract
          terms, he
          offered practical advice tailored to my personality and the way I communicate. His guidance played an
          important role in
          shaping my understanding of my future path and the kind of work I hope to create and leave behind.
        </ul>
        Finally, I sincerely thank everyone who has helped me along the way, and my parents for their unwavering
        support. Thank
        you all for allowing me to continue moving forward on this path.
